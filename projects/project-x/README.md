# Project X
## Rock Paper Scissor
_In this project, you will apply your new found Python and object-oriented programming skills to build a program that plays the popular game called_ **Rock Paper Scissor**. 

_You will write for_ : 
* Computer player (_follows various different strategies_)
* Human player. 

## About the game.
[Rock paper scissors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_paper_scissors) (also known as **scissors rock paper**, **paper rock scissors** and **scissors paper stone**) is a hand game usually played between two people, in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. These shapes are `rock` (**a closed fist**), `paper` (**a flat hand**), and `scissors` (**a fist with the index finger and middle finger extended, forming a V**). `Scissors` is identical to the two-fingered V sign (also indicating `victory` or "peace") except that it is pointed horizontally instead of being held upright in the air. A simultaneous, zero-sum game, it has only two possible outcomes: a draw, or a win for one player and a loss for the other.

## Game Play

The players usually count aloud to three, or speak the name of the game (e.g. "Rock! Paper! Scissors!" or "Ro Sham Bo!"), each time either raising one hand in a fist and swinging it down on the count or holding it behind. They then "throw" by extending it towards their opponent. Variations include a version where players use only three counts before throwing their gesture (thus throwing on the count of "Scissors!" or "Bo!"), or a version where they shake their hands three times before "throwing". You get the idea ðŸ˜€
