# Project One

## Mad Lib Generator 
_In this project, you will apply your new found Python and object-oriented programming skills to build a program that plays the popular word game  **Mad Lib Generator**. 

## About the game.
**Mad lib For Magic Computer**
![Mad lib](https://miro.medium.com/max/1600/1*8M2JfaTacGjI8YQlO9qF5A.jpeg "Mad lib")
**Mad Libs** is a phrasal template word game where one player prompts others for a list of words to substitute for blanks in a story before reading the – often comical or nonsensical – story aloud. The game is frequently played as a party game or as a pastime.

Read more about the game on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Libs)

## Format 
Mad Libs contain short stories on each page with many key words replaced with blanks. Beneath each blank is specified a category, such as "noun", "verb", "place", "celebrity," "Exclamation" or "part of the body". One player asks the other players, in turn, to contribute a word of the specified type for each blank, but without revealing the context for that word. Finally, the completed story is read aloud. The result is usually comic, surreal and somewhat nonsensical.

Here is an example : 
```
"___________! he said ________ as he jumped into his convertible
  exclamation           adverb
                                                     
  ______ and drove off with his _________ wife."
   noun                         adjective
```

After completion, sentence might read : 
```
"Ouch! he said stupidly as he jumped into his convertible cat and drove off with his brave wife.
```

## How to build the game. 
I have provided you with starter code. 

Condition : 
* The game must have 3 levels with different difficulty. 
    > _So if the user chooses, **easy** as the difficulty level, then the predefined easy level should be play._
* User must have **10** attempts (_for each level_) to get the right answer, if not it should be a game over. 
    >As the user get the right answer, swap the blank space with the right answer to show the user their progress.


## TIPS
> it will be wise to catch how the user types their inputs. 
> Please follow the DRY Principle religiously. 

## When and how to submit, 
+ Your code could be in `.py` if you are using VS code or `.ipynb` if you are using *JupyterNotebook*, the choice is yours.

+ You have until midnight **FRIDAY** `24:00 Lisbon Time or 00.00`
+ Any submission after the aforementioned time won't be accepted.
